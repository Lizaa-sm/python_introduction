# Hi everyone 

In this repository, I’m sharing the basics of Python programming.  
Everything I’ve learned so far is being compiled into these summaries.  

The goal is to have a quick and easy way to recall details that are sometimes forgotten, and to access this information in a clear and intuitive format.  

I also hope these notes can help others who are learning Python 🚀🐍  

See you around!
