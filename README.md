# Hi everyone!

That's it, these are my summaries. I don't want to lose them, and I think it's only fair to allow those who need them to use them.

In this repository, I’m sharing the basics of Python programming.  
Everything I’ve learned so far is being compiled into these summaries.  

The goal is to have a quick and easy way to recall details that are sometimes forgotten, and to access this information in a clear and intuitive format.  

Well, my summaries are based on the course: "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp – Jose Portilla"

I also hope these notes can help others who are learning Python 🚀🐍  

See you around!
